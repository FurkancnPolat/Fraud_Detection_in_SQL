# Fraud_Detection_in_SQL
Fraud Detection Project
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent activities in transaction data. The goal is to identify suspicious patterns and behaviors across customers and merchants by analyzing transaction details.

# Tasks Overview
The following tasks were performed as part of the fraud detection process:
Total Spending Calculation: Calculated the total spending of each customer.
High Spender Customers: Identified customers who spent more than 1000 units in total.
Fraud Suspicion Based on Multiple Transactions: Detected customers making multiple transactions on the same day.
Detect Fraud Based on Large Transactions: Identified customers making large transactions within a short time period.
Unusual Transaction Frequency: Detected customers with an abnormally high frequency of transactions.
High Risk Merchants: Identified merchants with high levels of fraudulent transactions.
Transactions from Multiple Locations: Detected customers making transactions from different locations in a short time period.
Abnormal Refund Patterns: Identified merchants with unusually high refund rates.
Duplicate Transactions: Detected customers with duplicate transactions.
Comprehensive Fraud Detection: Combined multiple factors (large transactions, high frequency, suspicious behaviors) to detect fraud.
# Tools & Technologies
SQL for querying and data analysis
WITH clause and CTE (Common Table Expressions) for structuring complex queries
Transaction data analysis to uncover fraud patterns
# How to Use
Set up your database and import transaction data.
Run the queries for each task to detect fraudulent behavior.
Analyze the results and flag suspicious activities for further investigation.
